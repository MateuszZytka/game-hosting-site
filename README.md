# Game Hosting Site

## Description

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is a game hosting site where you can play browser games, as well as track your high scores against yourself and
your friends.
Our motivation for developing this was because we felt that there arenâ€™t many game hosting websites like Miniclip and
AddictingGame left and wanted to bring back a bit of the early 2000s internet.
